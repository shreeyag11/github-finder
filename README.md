# GITHUB FINDER :mag_right:

We often come in the situation when we want to find somebody on github and we want to only checkout the number of repositories, followers and who that guy is following like general things about a user on Github. This web app does the exact same thing so that you don't need to go on github.com and then search for that person. You can put the username of the person that you want to search and then you will get all the relevant information about him or her within a second.

## What does it do?

It searches for all the Github users using the text inputted by the user in the form. It returns all the users matching the string in a grid format. Clicking on the more tab takes the user to a custom made page with the vital stats.
